# A-lil-Bit-Salty
## Project Description
Our  app is called A-lil-Bit-Salty. It is picture based food app for people with a unique TASTE of humor. The app allows users to submit comments under not-so-attractive foods.  Users can select specific pictures they want to comment under. The kicker is, users can update, or even delete anyones comments.It is a community of satire commenting on disgusting images of "delicious" meals.  In the future, we would like to add a feature that allows user's contents as well user authentication, a feature that would only allow  a specific user to edit, or delete their own comment.
